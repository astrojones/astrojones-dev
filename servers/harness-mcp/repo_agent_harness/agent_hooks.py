"""Claude Code hook handlers, exposed via ``repo-agent-harness hook <event>``.

Pure functions: take the hook event payload, return the hook JSON response
(empty dict = allow / no output). The CLI wrapper (``repo-agent-harness hook``)
or the lightweight ``main`` below — invoked as ``python -m
repo_agent_harness.agent_hooks <event>`` by the plugin hook to skip the heavy
CLI import — owns stdin/stdout and fail-open behavior, so a hook problem never
blocks legitimate work.
